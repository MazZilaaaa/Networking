## Next steps
### Logging system
It will be usefull to log everything that happens in the library while sending requests and receiving responses
- logging system report
- online logging system report

### Autogenerating Endpoint
It will be usefull:
- to create Endpoints from swagger
- to create automocks from logging system reports

### Autotesting integration between backed and mobile applications
 some times the contracts is changing without changing to other side, 
 for example backed side has changed contracts but client side didnt do that, and crash error happens
 we want to suggest the way for testing current contracts beetwen backed and client sides
 the idea is that just send request and get response for every endpoint
